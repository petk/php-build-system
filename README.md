## Quick usage - TL;DR

### Step 1 - Install prerequisites

```sh
# Prerequisites for Debian-based distributions:
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ bison libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev

# Prerequisites for Fedora-based distributions:
sudo dnf install cmake gcc gcc-c++ bison libxml2-devel sqlite-devel
```

  ```sh
  # Prerequisites for macOS:
  xcode-select --install   # XCode command line tools
  brew install cmake bison # See https://brew.sh how to install Homebrew

  # Prerequisites for Alpine Linux:
  sudo apk add --no-cache cmake make gcc g++ bison libxml2-dev sqlite-dev

  # Prerequisites for BSD-based systems:
  sudo pkg install cmake bison libxml2 sqlite3

  # Prerequisites for Haiku:
  pkgman install cmake bison libxml2_devel sqlite_devel

  # Prerequisites for Solaris/illumos-based systems:
  sudo pkg install cmake bison libxml2 sqlite-3
  ```
</details>

### Step 2 - Clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/petk/php-build-system

cd php-build-system
```

### Step 3 - Download PHP and add CMake files

```sh
cmake -P bin/php.cmake
```

### Step 4 - Generate build system to a build directory

```sh
cmake -S php-8.5-dev -B php-build
```

### Step 5 - Build PHP in parallel

```sh
cmake --build php-build -j
```

After build is complete, you should have a PHP binary that can be run on the
command line:

```sh
./php-build/sapi/cli/php -v
```

## Introduction

PHP developers typically opt for convenient methods to set up PHP on their
machines, such as utilizing prebuilt Linux packages available in their Linux
distribution repositories, deploying Docker images, or relying on user-friendly
stacks that bundle PHP, its extensions, web server, and database into a unified
installation package.

```sh
# Debian-based distributions:
sudo apt install php...

# Fedora-based distributions:
sudo dnf install php...
```

In contrast, the practice of building PHP from source code is primarily reserved
for specific purposes, such as PHP source code development or extensive
customization of PHP configurations on a particular system. This approach is
less commonly employed by everyday PHP developers due to its intricate and
time-consuming nature.

In the realm of software development, a build system is a collection of tools
and files that automate the process of compiling, linking, and assembling the
project's source code into its final form, ready to be executed. It helps
developers with repetitive tasks and ensures consistency and correctness in the
build process for various platforms and hardware out there.

A key function of a build system in the context of C/C++ software development is
to establish a structured framework that guides how code should be written.
Beyond its primary role of compiling source files into executable programs, the
build system plays a pivotal educational role, imparting best practices and
coding standards to developers. By enforcing consistency and adherence to coding
conventions, it fosters the creation of high-quality code, ultimately enhancing
software maintainability and reliability.

Additionally, the build system aims to enable developers to work efficiently by
abstracting away system-specific details, allowing them to focus on the logic
and usability of their code. When adding a new source file or making minor
modifications, developers shouldn't have to delve into the inner workings of the
build system, sift through extensive build system documentation or extensively
explore the complexities of the underlying system.

There are numerous well-known build systems available, ranging from the veteran
GNU Autotools and the widely adopted CMake, to the efficient Ninja, versatile
SCons, adaptable Meson, nimble xmake, and even the simplest manual usage of
Make.

## PHP directory structure

To understand the PHP source code better, it would be beneficial to grasp its
directory structure. PHP is developed at the
[php-src GitHub repository](https://github.com/php/php-src).

After cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/php/php-src
cd php-src
```

you end up with a large monolithic repository consisting of C source code files,
PHP tests and other associated files:

```sh

## Why CMake?

At the time of writing, CMake is actively developed, and many developers may
already be familiar with it, making C code more appealing to new contributors.
Numerous IDEs offer excellent CMake integration for C/C++ projects.

CMake shares many similarities with Autotools, which simplifies the learning
curve for those already accustomed to building C code using existing systems.

Notably, CMake features better out-of-the-box support on Windows systems, where
Autotools may encounter issues without additional adaptations and adjustments in
the build process.

Despite Autotools potentially seeming complex and arcane to new developers,
unfamiliar with it, it remains a robust and solid build system option for C/C++
projects on \*nix systems. Many large open-source projects use Autotools, and
some even incorporate it alongside CMake.
