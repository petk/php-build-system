\*nix build system (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Haiku, etc.) in PHP
uses [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) to build a `configure`
shell script that further creates a `Makefile` to build sources to executable
binaries.

```sh
# Create Autotools configure script
./buildconf

# Configure PHP build and create Makefile
./configure

# Build PHP
make
```

The `buildconf` is a simple shell script wrapper around `autoconf` and
`autoheader` command-line tools. It checks required Autoconf version, creates
`configure` command-line script and `main/php_config.h.in` header template.

When running the `./configure`, many checks are done based on the host and
targeted system. Things like C headers availability, C symbols, required library
dependencies, etc.

The `configure` script creates `Makefile` where the `make` command then builds
binary files from C source files. You can optionally pass the `-j` option with
the number of simultaneous jobs so the build runs faster in parallel.

```sh
make -j 10
```

When compiling is done, the tests can be run with:

```sh
make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j10 test
```

> [!NOTE]
> Number of simultaneous jobs is often the number of available processor threads
> of the build machine and can be also automatically calculated using the
> `$(nproc)` on Linux, or `$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` on macOS and BSD-based systems.
>
> ```sh
> make -j $(nproc)
> ```

PHP \*nix build system is pretty much standard GNU Autotools build system with
few customizations. It doesn't use Automake and it bundles some 3rd party files
for easier installation across various systems out there without requiring
installation dependencies. Autotools is a veteran build system present since
early C/C++ days. It is used for most Linux ecosystem out there and it might
cause issues for C developers today.

## 1. Directory structure

PHP build system is a collection of various files across the php-src repository:

## 3. Build requirements

Before you can build PHP on Linux and other Unix-like systems, you must first
install certain third-party requirements. It's important to note that the names
of these requirements may vary depending on your specific system. For the sake
of simplicity, we will use generic names here. When building PHP from source,
one crucial requirement is a library containing development files. Such
libraries are typically packaged under names like `libfoo-dev`, `libfoo-devel`,
or similar conventions. For instance, to install the `libxml2` library, you
would look for the `libxml2-dev` (or `libxml2-devel`) package.

Required:

* autoconf
* make
* gcc
* g++
* pkg-config
* libxml2
* libsqlite3

Additionally required when building from Git repository source code:

* bison
* re2c

## 4. The configure command-line options

Configuration can be passed on the command line at the configuration phase:

```sh
./configure VAR=VALUE --enable-FEATURE --with-PACKAGE
```

With Autoconf, there are two main types of command-line options for the
`configure` script (`--enable-FEATURE` and `--with-PACKAGE`):

* `--enable-FEATURE[=ARG]` and its belonging opposite `--disable-FEATURE`

  `--disable-FEATURE` is the same as `--enable-FEATURE=no`

  These normally don't require 3rd party library or package installed on the
  system. For some extensions, PHP bundles 3rd party dependencies in the
  extension itself. For example, `bcmath`, `gd`, etc.

* `--with-PACKAGE[=ARG]` and its belonging opposite `--without-PACKAGE`

  `--without-PACKAGE` is the same as `--with-PACKAGE=no`

  These require 3rd party package installed on the system. PHP has even some
  libraries bundled in PHP source code. For example, the PCRE library and
  similar.

Other custom options that don't follow this pattern are used for adjusting
specific features during the build process.

See `./configure --help` for all available configuration options and variables.

Some common arguments can be passed to command-line options:

* To build extension as shared: `--enable-EXT=shared` or `--with-EXT=shared`.
* Some options accept multiple arguments separated by comma (`,`). For example,
  passing the library location and similar: `--with-EXT=shared,/usr`

## 5. Determining platform

With Autotools there are several shell variables that help determine the
platform characteristics such as CPU, operating system and vendor name. When
using macros `AC_CANONICAL_BUILD`, `AC_CANONICAL_HOST`, and
`AC_CANONICAL_TARGET` in the M4 files, `config.sub` and `config.sub` scripts
help determine the values of variables `build_alias`, `host_alias`, and
`target_alias`.

Users can also manually override these variables for their specific case using
the `--build`, `--host`, and `--target` configure options.

In M4 files platform can be then determined using above shell variables in
variety of ways:

```m4
AS_CASE([$host_alias], [*freebsd*|*openbsd*],
  [AC_MSG_NOTICE([Action that is run only on FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems.])])
```

## 6. Common checks

### 6.1. Testing if program works

There are 3 main Autoconf macros that check if certain test code is successful.

Let's check a simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}
```

#### 6.1.1. AC_COMPILE_IFELSE

```m4
AC_COMPILE_IFELSE([AC_LANG_PROGRAM([#include <stdio.h>],
  [printf("Hello World")])],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=yes],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=no])
```

The `AC_LANG_PROGRAM` macro will expand this into:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello World")
  ;
  return 0;
}
```

The `AC_COMPILE_IFELSE` will run the compilation step, for example:

```sh
gcc -o out -c hello_world.c
```

#### 6.1.2. AC_LINK_IFELSE

```m4
AC_LINK_IFELSE([AC_LANG_PROGRAM([#include <stdio.h>],
  [printf("Hello World")])],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=yes],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=no])
```

This will run compilation and linking:

```sh
gcc -o out hello_world.c
```

#### 6.1.3. AC_RUN_IFELSE

This will compile, link and also run the program to check if the return code is
0.

Issue with `AC_RUN_IFELSE` is when doing so-called cross-compilation. That is
building C software on one platform with purpose of running it on some other
platform. In this case the program cannot be run and we cannot be sure of if it
is running successfully or not.

```m4
AC_RUN_IFELSE([AC_LANG_PROGRAM([#include <stdio.h>],
  [printf("Hello World")])],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=yes],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=no],
  [php_cv_func_printf_works=cross-compiling])
```

This does something like this:

```sh
gcc -o out hello_world.c
./out
```

### 6.2. Functions

Testing if function exists within the given header.

A common way to check for function is using the `AC_CHECK_FUNC` or
`AC_CHECK_FUNCS` macros. These check if the linker sees the function in the
usual libraries (libc and the ones appended to the `LIBS` variable). However,
many times, functions also have their belonging headers, so it makes sense to
check for both using this:

```m4
AC_CHECK_HEADER([priv.h], [AC_CHECK_FUNCS([setpflags])])
```

This first checks if header `priv.h` exists, and if so, it then checks if linker
sees the function. They can be used like this:

```c
#ifdef HAVE_SETPFLAGS
# include <priv.h>
#endif

/* ... */

/* Call setpflags. */
#ifdef HAVE_SETPFLAGS
    setpflags(...)
#else
    /* ... */
#endif
```

## 7. GNU Autoconf Archive

To reuse the code there is a community collection of Autoconf macros available
at [autoconf-archive](https://github.com/autoconf-archive/autoconf-archive).

PHP is not using Automake so it includes them like this in `configure.ac`:

```m4
m4_include([build/ax_..._.m4])
m4_include([build/...macro.m4])
# ...
```

They can be than called and expanded in the m4 code:

```m4
AX_MACRO_CALL(...)
```

When using Automake, these can be automatically included like this:

```m4
AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([path/to/m4/dir])
```

However, the `aclocal` from Automake is needed for this to work.

## 8. Parser and lexer files

Parser and lexer files are generated upon the build step (`make`) with `bison`
and `re2c` tools based on the targets in `Makefile.frag` files.

There is also a helper shell script available that generates these files when
developing or releasing PHP source code, otherwise they.

```sh
./scripts/dev/genfiles
```

Autotools-based PHP build system files related to `bison` and `re2c`:

```sh
<php-src>/
 └─ build/
    └─ php.m4                       # Autoconf macros with re2c and bison macros
 └─ ext/
    └─ json/
       └─ Makefile.frag             # Makefile fragment

 └─ configure.ac                    # Minimum re2c and bison versions settings
```
